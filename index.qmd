## What Should I Do Before Class Begins?

In addition to exploring what's available on this website, you should ...

1. **Buy the book**. During the course, we will read Paul Rosenbaum's book **Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference**, which is available as an e-book or in paperback for under $40. Please read the Preface and Chapter 1 before our first class on XXXX.

2. Once you have registered for the course, please visit our [Welcome to 500 survey](https://bit.ly/500-welcome-2024). You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to access the survey, which should take about 10 minutes to complete. Please complete the survey as soon as possible, ideally before our first class at 8:30 AM on 2024-01-18 in Wolstein Research Building room 1217.

3. **Download the software**. Install R and RStudio and some necessary R packages on a computer you can control throughout the semester. Details [are available here](software.qmd).
